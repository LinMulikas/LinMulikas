- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Application of 2024 Fall PhD in Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and related areas. And I'm also reviewing the courses I'm taken to prapare for the Summer Camp of CUHK and other possible coming interview.
- ðŸ’» I'm doing some learn in the research of Neural Network. And try to review some knowledge I've learnt.

- ðŸ“– Iâ€™m interested in Applied Mathematics, Programming Language Theory, Computer Algebra, AI, especially AI for Science.
  - Programming Language Theory.
    Especially the Functional Programming, I've leant the basic knowledge of Haskell, Lisp. And I'm interested in some other pattern of programming language.
  - Computer Algebra.
    I want to learn something about the Symbolic Equation, but this may need some other algebraic background.
  - AI, AI for Science.
    I feel there maybe some connection between Language itself and the human intelligence. So I'll try to build the knowledge I need.
    AI for Science is something like use AI tools in Applied Mathematics in my opinion. So I'll also learn the basic idea of AI in the modern era.

- ðŸŽ¸ I'll be a vocal in a coming Chinese Rock Band.
  I like some music like The Gar.
